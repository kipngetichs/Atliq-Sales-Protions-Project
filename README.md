AtliQ Mart Company is  a prominent retail chain with over 50 supermarkets in southern India, they ran extensive promotions on their branded products during the festive periods of Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024. The sales director sought to evaluate the effectiveness of these promotions to make data-driven decisions for future campaigns. My project involved analyzing the sales data that i collected from codebasics.io website for  this period to identify which promotions succeeded and which did not, providing actionable insights for the company's upcoming promotional strategies.
# Task
As a Data and Business Analyst for AtliQ Mart, my task was to analyze sales data from their extensive promotional campaigns conducted during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024. This involved cleaning and processing large datasets, performing detailed statistical analyses, and creating visualizations to identify trends and patterns. My goal was to determine which promotions were most successful and provide actionable insights to the sales director, enabling data-driven decision-making for future promotional strategies.
# Action
In this project, I employed advanced Excel techniques, including VLOOKUP and INDEX MATCH functions, to efficiently look up and cross-reference values from multiple tables. These functions enabled me to merge and analyze disparate datasets, ensuring accurate and comprehensive data analysis. By leveraging these tools, I could effectively identify key insights and trends, providing a solid foundation for actionable recommendations to optimize AtliQ Mart's future promotional strategies.The preview of the dashboard is available below.

# Recommendations
- Focusing on High-Performing Campaigns: Given that the Diwali campaigns contributed 60% of the revenue post-promotions compared to Sankranti's 40%, prioritizing and allocate more resources towards Diwali promotions in the future.
- Promoting Top-Performing Products: Continue to feature and promote top-performing products such as Atliq_Home_Essential_8_Product_Combo, Atliq_Sonamasuri_Rice (10KG), Atliq_Farm_Chakki_Atta (1KG), Atliq_waterproof_Immersion_Rod, and Atliq_Double_Bedsheet_set, as they have shown the highest income contributions.
- Utilizing Effective Promotion Types: Leveraging the 500 Cashback and BOGOF promotion type more frequently, as they have proven to be the most successful. Reevaluating or phasing out less effective promotions like 25% OFF and 50% OFF, which did not perform well.
- Focusing on Responsive Product Categories: Concentrating promotional efforts on product categories such as Combo1 and Grocery & Staples, which responded well to promotions. Considering reducing promotions for Home Appliances, Home Care, and Personal Care, which did not perform as well.
- Targeting High-Performing Cities: Directing marketing and promotional efforts towards the top-performing cities: Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Mysuru, and Coimbatore, where the response to promotions was the strongest, resulting in the highest revenue.
